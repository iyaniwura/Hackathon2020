## Team Aim:

Build a metapopulation model taking different quarantine methods into account; Use numerical simulation to find out what approaches are effective in local outbreak prevention and disease control; (Perhaps) BCCDC professionals can determine the most economic and powerful control measures based on this.

## Team Progress:

We already have the (primary) model, we coded it up, we nunmerically solved the systems of ODEs and ran simulations based on some made-up data (Team Flight we need you!), and we have the visualization!
