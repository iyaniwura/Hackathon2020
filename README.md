# EpiCoronaHack 2020 - Team Quarantine (transmission)

## Team Member:

* David Cameron (BC Cancer)
* Brandon Chan (BC Cancer)
* Rebeca Cardim Falcao (UBC)
* Sarafa Iyaniwura (UBC)
* Mechthild Kellas-Dicks 
* Liangchen Liu (UBC)
* Stephen Zhang (UBC)

## Team Aim:

* Build a metapopulation model for different regions 
  ** with  quarantine
  ** withoutquarantine 
* Use numerical simulation (in Python) to determine the effect different intervention strategies on local outbreak prevention and disease control; (Perhaps) BCCDC professionals can determine the most effective and economical  control measures based on this. 
* Develop a visualization tools to aid in model parameter investigation, selection, and outcomes. This tool will also help in investigating the sensitivity of the parameters of the model.

## Team Progress:

We already have the (primary) model, we coded it up, we nunmerically solved the systems of ODEs and ran simulations based on some made-up data (Team Flight we need you!), and we have the visualization!
